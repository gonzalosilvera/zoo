# Zoo

This repository contains the solution to an exercise for a front-end developer position. It includes a user interface designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Key aspects of the implementation include:
- The use of vector images and icons sourced from:
    - [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/)
    - [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/)
- Image editing performed using Adobe Illustrator.

## Exercise 
 
We are building a zoo inside a computer. Each animal species in our zoo has lots 
of different, particular, behaviors, but all animals talk to each other in a similar 
way. Specifically, they all implement a ​speak​ method, the output of which is the 
arbitrary input string interspersed with an "animal sound" that is particular to that 
type of animal. For example, the lion's ​speak​ function behaves like so: 
 
lion.speak( ​"I'm a lion"​ ); 
​"I'm roar a roar lion roar" 
 
The tiger's speak function behaves similarly but with a different sound: 
 
tiger.speak( ​"Lions suck"​ ); 
​"Lions grrr suck grrr" 
 
Please write logic and classes to support our zoo in JavaScript ​with attention to 
code structure and readability​.
